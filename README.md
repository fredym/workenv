Work environment
================

My computing environment setup expressed in code.


Installation
------------

Clone this repo and run `setup.sh`. This will install a bunch of tools using
[brew].

_WARNING: `setup.sh` will set the computer name to `aleph`. You need to edit
`setup.sh` and specify yours. This is being tracked on #9._

    $ cd
    $ git clone https://github.com/fredym/workenv.git
    $ cd workenv
    $ chmod +r setup.sh
    $ ./setup.sh
